<blockquote> "The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop liking or disliking for things merely because they are familiar with them." <p style="text-align:right;">&#8212; Wikipedia Â  "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect" target="_blank">Mere-exposure effect</a>"</p> </blockquote>

<p>The dozen sharp plastic tips pressed into my back leading to a diverse array of raised bumps: I was allergic to almost everything. A consultation later, I sat with the low hum of the office A/C as I waited for the soreness in my arm to disappate. I would be receiving an injection every two days for the next three years.</p>

<p>I had to spend 30 minutes after the injection to make sure I didn't get a severe reaction, and spent these moments chatting with the doctor who made many passes by the waiting room. Soon, I began to fall in love with medicine.</p>

<p>And as my allergies faded, my love for medicine grew. I would end up enrolling at UCSB in the microbiology major where I conducted research into the Pink Berry Consortium with the Wilbanks Lab.</p>

<p>During this time, I received an invite to work as an Optometric Technician and this position would lead to me being offered a position as a Clinical Rearcher conducting Phase III trials.</p>
